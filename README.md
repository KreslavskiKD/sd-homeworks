# The Pickle Rick Experience: A Roguelike Adventure

## Overall

Welcome to the seedy underbelly of the city, where danger lurks around every corner. As the genius scientist Rick Sanchez, you've transformed yourself into Pickle Rick but ended up in the sewers and now have to infiltrate this dangerous world and get back to your lab. But be warned, the inhabitants of this city of sewers' are not to be trifled with.

Your goal is to navigate the city's dark alleys and seedy hideouts, battling roaches and rats, avoiding traps, and gathering powerful upgrades. But be warned, death is permanent in this dangerous world, and the only way to escape is to either reach the coveted portal gun, hidden deep within the city, or find a pipe to the upperworld and use your torso upgrades to move up.

At the beginning of your journey, you find yourself in a damp sewer, armed only with your pickle powers and your pickle teeth. The area is teeming with rats and cockroaches, each posing a different threat to your journey.

Speaking of your abilities, you'll need to carefully manage what you can do with your pickle form, as there are limits to how much you can do at any given time. You'll be able to move quickly (not in a pickle form), fit through small spaces, and even fight, but you'll also be vulnerable to certain attacks.

As you journey deeper into the city of sewers, you'll encounter increasingly dangerous foes, but you'll also find more powerful items to aid you in your quest. Can you survive the dangers of the seedy city, defeat the rats and roaches, and uncover the secrets of this underworld? The fate of the multiverse rests in your hands, Pickle Rick!
